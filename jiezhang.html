Jie (Jay) Zhang is an engineer with expertise in numerical modeling especially computational fluid dynamics (CFD) of environmental flows in engineered/natural systems. He earned a PhD degree in Civil Engineering at the University of South Florida. He is a pioneer in investigating water and wastewater treatment problems from the perspective of fluid mechanics; He also developed CFD models for ocean flows and microfluidics and process models for ion exchange, chlorine/chloramine disinfection, Reverse Osmosis System and lead-copper corrosion. He is a leader in promoting advanced modeling techniques such as CFD in the community of civil and environmental engineers; He helped to start an ASCE EWRI task committee on computational fluid dynamics and served as the founding chair for years. Through the committee he organized technical sessions and workshops at national/international conferences and co-edited a CFD book. He is a recipient of the 2020 ASCE State-of-The-Art of Civil Engineering Award.
